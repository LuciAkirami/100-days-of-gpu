### **Code Explanation**:

The provided code benchmarks and compares the performance of **Host to Device** and **Device to Host** memory transfers in CUDA for **pageable** and **pinned** memory.

#### 1. **Error Checking**:

-   The `cudaCheck` function is an inline helper function that checks for CUDA runtime errors. It checks whether the CUDA operation was successful by calling `cudaSuccess`. If not, it logs an error message and asserts to stop further execution in debug mode.

#### 2. **Memory Transfer Profiling**:

-   The `profileCopies` function profiles the memory transfer speeds between the host and device using **CUDA events** (`cudaEventCreate`, `cudaEventRecord`, and `cudaEventElapsedTime`).
-   The function performs two types of memory transfers:
    -   **Host to Device** transfer (copying data from the host's pageable or pinned memory to device memory).
    -   **Device to Host** transfer (copying data back from device memory to the host).
-   For both transfers, it records the start and stop times using CUDA events and computes the bandwidth in **GB/s**. The `cudaMemcpy` function is used to perform the actual data transfer.
-   It also verifies the correctness of the transfers by comparing the data from the host and device.

#### 3. **Memory Allocation**:

-   **Pageable Memory**: Regular memory allocated using `malloc`.
-   **Pinned (Page-Locked) Memory**: Memory allocated using `cudaMallocHost`, which is faster for memory transfers but cannot be swapped out to disk by the operating system.
-   **Device Memory**: Memory allocated using `cudaMalloc` for GPU transfers.

#### 4. **Device Properties**:

-   The code queries and prints information about the CUDA device being used (in this case, device 0).

#### 5. **Transfer Profiling Output**:

-   The program prints the **Host to Device** and **Device to Host** bandwidth for both pageable and pinned memory. This provides an understanding of how the transfer speed varies based on the memory type used.

#### 6. **Memory Cleanup**:

-   After the benchmarking is complete, the program frees all allocated memory using `free` for pageable memory, and `cudaFree` and `cudaFreeHost` for device and pinned memory, respectively.

### **Execution Command**:

To compile and run the program using the NVIDIA CUDA compiler (`nvcc`), the following commands are used:

```bash
!nvcc perfCopy.cu -o perfCopy  # Compile the code into an executable named perfCopy
./perfCopy                # Run the compiled executable
```

The first command compiles the CUDA program `perfCopy.cu` and produces the executable `perfCopy`. The second command runs the program, which will print out the device's transfer performance for both pageable and pinned memory.
