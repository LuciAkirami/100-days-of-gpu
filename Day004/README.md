SAXPY is a mathematical operation that multiplies a vector by a scalar and adds it to another vector. It stands for **"Single-Precision AÂ·X Plus Y"**. It's a function in the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) library.

The SAXPY equation is basically

y = a \* x + y

where **"a"** is a scaler and **"x"** and **"y"** are vectors
